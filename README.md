# Blog Media Processor

A Python tool for processing blog posts with media markers to automatically extract video clips and screenshots from a source video.

## Features

- Supports both Word documents (.docx) and text files (.txt)
- Extracts video clips with specified duration
- Captures screenshots at specific timestamps
- Configurable media alignment and captions
- Detailed logging and error reporting
- Highlight Reel Maker with title cards and automatic clip extraction

## How it works
- See "Directory_ExplanationOfFiles" for full explanation of the different files and how they fit together, for the blog processor to work.

## Charlie notes on usage 

Prior to this: 
1. Run the Whisper project to get the transscript with timestamps. 
2. Add the Granola notes and the transcript to the Claude project, and ask it to run the analysis prompt first, then the blog one. Edit if needed. 
3. Copy with no formatting (cmd shift v) to GDocs, and save as .docx
4. Create a Medium placeholder blog post, to grab the URL. 
5. Ask Claude to run the social media prompt, and then save the outputs to Drive.

### To run the blog post processor:

1. [first-time setup only] Create and activate a virtual environment, install the dependencies, and install the package in development mode:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

2 Run the processor:
```bash
python run_processor.py
```

3. A UI window will pop up where you can:
   - Select your blog text file (with media markers)
   - Select your meeting video file
   - Click "Process Blog" to start

4. The processor will:
   - Extract screenshots and video clips based on the markers
   - Generate an HTML file with all content and media
   - Save everything to the `processed_blogs` folder

5. After processing:
   - Check the outputs in the `processed_blogs` folder
   - Once you've verified everything, you can move the outputs to Drive
   - Delete the contents of `processed_blogs` to keep the folder clean for next time

### Highlight Reel Maker

To create a highlight reel:

1. Run the highlight reel maker:
```bash
python run_highlight_reel.py
```

2. In the UI window:
   - Select your source video file
   - Enter your reel instructions in the text area
   - Click "Generate Highlight Reel"

3. The reel instructions should follow this format:
```
 [Title] AI vs. AI: Week 6 Highlight Reel

[Segment] Battling Uncooperative PDFs
[Description] Charlotte explains her attempts to extract data from Wealthfront statements and the challenges with Google Apps Script.
[CLIP timestamp="00:03:50" duration="45"]
[Description] Comparing the two different calculation approaches used by ChatGPT and Grok that led to slightly different results.
[CLIP timestamp="00:25:15" duration="50"]

[Segment] Creating a Dr. Seuss-Inspired Childrenâ€™s Book
[Description] Charlotte walks through the initial story generated by ChatGPT for her niece Zoe's children's book.
[CLIP timestamp="00:37:20" duration="40"]
[Description] Demonstration of how AI illustration tools struggle with character consistency, sometimes merging features between characters.
[CLIP timestamp="00:44:30" duration="35"]

...
```

4. The processor will:
   - Create title cards for each segment / description
   - Extract the specified video clips
   - Combine everything into a final video
   - Save the output to the `highlight_reels` folder

## Media Markers

The blog processor recognizes two types of media markers in your blog document:

1. **Video Clips**:
```
[CLIP timestamp="1:30" duration="5" align="center"]Optional caption text[/CLIP]
```

2. **Screenshots**:
```
[SCREENSHOT timestamp="2:45" align="center"]Optional caption text[/SCREENSHOT]
```

Timestamps can be specified in the following formats:
- `MM:SS` (e.g., "1:30")
- `HH:MM:SS` (e.g., "00:01:30")
- Seconds (e.g., "90" or "90.5")

## Error Handling

The processor includes comprehensive error handling and logging:
- Invalid timestamps or durations
- Missing or inaccessible files
- Media extraction failures
- Duplicate timestamps

All errors and warnings are logged to the console with appropriate context.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyQt6 (for the UI)
- python-docx (for Word document processing)
- moviepy (for video processing)
- imageio (for image handling)
- OpenCV (for video processing)
